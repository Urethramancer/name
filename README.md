# name
Merges functionality of the dirname and basename shell commands.

## Usage
`name -h` for help. `name` mostly works by removing parts you don't want from a filename. The exceptions are the `-S` flag, which returns the suffix without a dot, and the `-a` flag, which will expand the path from a relative path to a full path.
